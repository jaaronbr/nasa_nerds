        Summary:\n\nSolar activity was at low levels during this reporting period.
        There was 1 C-type CME (see details below). Based on preliminary heliospheric
        modeling carried out at NASA Community Coordinated Modeling Center, it was
        estimated that this CME (starting at 2019-04-03T04:09Z) may impact Spitzer
        at around 2019-04-05T22:20Z (plus minus 7 hours) and may have a flank impact
        at STEREO A at around 2019-04-06T00:00Z (plus minus 7 hours) (see notification
        20190404-AL-001). This CME arrival was possibly detected by STEREO A IMPACT/PLASTIC
        instruments at around 2019-04-05T11:00Z.\n\nGeomagnetic activity was at below
        minor levels with Kp index (a measure of geomagnetic activity, ranging 0-9)
        <=4 for the reporting period. The highest value of Kp=4 occurred during the
        synoptic periods of 2019-04-03T03:00Z-06:00Z, 2019-04-08T03:00Z-06:00Z and
        2019-04-09T00:00Z-03:00Z. These slight increases in geomagnetic activity were
        associated with the arrival of two small coronal hole high speed streams detected
        by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 around 2019-04-04 and 2019-04-08, respectively. The
        solar wind speed reached values of ~530 km/s on 2019-04-05 and ~480 km/s on
        2019-05-08.\n\nThe >0.8 MeV energetic electron flux in the Earth''s outer
        radiation belt crossed the threshold level of 10^5 pfu starting at 2019-04-05T15:30Z.
        These significantly elevated energetic electron fluxes in the Earth''s outer
        radiation belt detected by GOES are associated with the coronal hole high
        speed stream on 2019-04-04 described above (see notifications 20190405-AL-002
        and 20190407-AL-001).\n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected
        at GOES and the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A were all at background levels
        for the entire reporting period. \n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather
        impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been low to moderate this
        week due to the elevated energetic electron flux on the Earth''s outer radiation
        belt described above.\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \nNone

        There were no significant flares or CMEs.  \n   \nGeomagnetic activity was
        at below minor levels with Kp index (a measure of geomagnetic activity, ranging

        There was 1 C-type CME (see details below). Based on preliminary heliospheric
        modeling carried out at NASA Community Coordinated Modeling Center, it was
        estimated that this CME (starting at 2019-03-20T08:24:00Z) may impact OSIRIS-REx
        (glancing blow) at around 2019-03-24T00:00Z (plus minus 7 hours) and missions
        near Earth at around 2019-03-23T11:11Z (see notifications 20190320-AL-001
        and 20190321-AL-001). This CME arrival was detected by DSCOVR/ACE at L1 around
        2019-03-24T20:43Z.  \n \nGeomagnetic activity was at below minor levels with
        Kp index (a measure of geomagnetic activity, ranging 0-9) <=3 for the reporting

        Summary:\n\nSolar activity was at low levels during this reporting period.  There
        were no significant flares or CMEs.  \n\nGeomagnetic activity was at minor
        levels with Kp index (a measure of geomagnetic activity, ranging 0-9) <=5
        for the reporting period. The highest value of Kp=5 occurred during the synoptic
        period of 2019-03-17T00:00Z-03:00Z. This elevation of geomagnetic activity
        was associated with a combination of the arrival of a weak coronal hole high
        speed stream detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 around 2019-03-15 and the arrival
        of a S-type CME around 2019-03-17.  Solar wind speed reached values of ~450
        km/s on 2019-03-17.  \n\nThe > 0.8 MeV energetic electron flux detected at
        GOES remained below the threshold level of 10^5 pfu for the entire reporting
        period. \n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES
        and the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A were all at background levels for the
        entire reporting period. \n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts
        on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been low this week.\n\n##Events:\nFlares

        \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2019-03-26T23:59Z\n\nSolar activity is expected
        to be low to moderate for the upcoming week. There are currently several small
        active regions present on the visible solar disk that may have some potential
        for flares or CMEs.  Recently numbered active region 12736 had some flare
        activity, the highest being a C4.8 class flare that peaked at 2019-03-20T11:18Z.  A
        C-type CME was associated with this activity. Based on preliminary heliospheric
        modeling carried out at NASA Community Coordinated Modeling Center, it is
        estimated that this CME may affect OSIRIS-REx (glancing blow) around 2019-03-24T00:00Z
        (plus minus 7 hours). The simulation also indicates that the CME may impact
        NASA missions near Earth around 2019-03-23T11:11Z (plus minus 7 hours). The
        roughly estimated expected range of the maximum Kp index is 3-5 (below minor
        to minor) (see notification 20190320-AL-001).  \n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification
